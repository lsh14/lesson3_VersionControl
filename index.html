            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system. It can be used as a server out of the box. Nearly every operation in git is local, everything in git is check summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. Therefore it is impossible to change the conents of any file or directory without git knowing about it. It is much different than other version control systems even though they appear similar.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three states in git. There is the git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The git directory is where git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer. The working tree is where the files are pulled out of the compressed database in the git directory and placed on a disk for you to use or modify. And lastly the staging area is a file that stores information about what will go into your next commit.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over timeso that you can recall specific versions later. There are several different types of version control and they can be local, centralized, or distributed. A version control system is a very wise thing to use to keep records and revert to files in a previous state. That way you can compare changes over time, see what modifications were used and who used them.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was created in 2005, and since then has evolved to be easy to use and still retained its initial qualities. Those qualities include speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, its fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Originally the Linux kernel project began using a prprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. The commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down and the tool's free of charge status was no more. This prompted the Linux development community to develop their own tool, and thus Git was born.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">All files in your working directory are either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, and untracked files are everything else. Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because git just checked them out and you haven't edited anything yet. As you edit files, git sees them as modified because you've changed them since your last commit.</p>
